- Our vision is to develop a circular economy model for a Hi-Tech manufacturing company. The objectives of our strategy include: To extend the lifecycles of the materials used in the manufacturing supply chain.  Promoting Reuse, and recycling of materials.  Minimizing the use of finite resources in supply chain, operations, and logistics.
